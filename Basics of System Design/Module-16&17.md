# RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)

1. It's a piece of software
2. Perform CRUD operation on data
3. Data stored in the from of tables

# Advantages

- No data redundency
- Data concurrency ===> RDBMS has a locking system which prevent abnormalities from occuring.
- Data searching by search query
- Data Integrity ===> Same type of data

# Limitations

- Rigid schema
- High cost
- Scalability issues (Horizontal scaling/sharding is very difficult) ===> Vertical scaling is easy.

Issue with Horizontal scaling with RDBMS ===> Releated tables
