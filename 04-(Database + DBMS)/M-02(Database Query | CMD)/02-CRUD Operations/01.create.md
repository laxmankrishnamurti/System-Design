# CREATE OPERATION

### 1. Insert a document

```bash
# first of all create a collection by running this cmd
$ db.createCollection('demo')

# then insert a document
$ db.demo.insertOne({'name': 'Laxman krishnamurti', 'age': 22, 'email': 'laxmankrishnamurti@gmail.com'})
```

```bash
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: ObjectId('67293sdf2w1c2b214285b321f2a5bb8d')
}
```

### 2. Insert many documents

```bash
$ db.demo.insertOne(
    {'name': 'Kawya krishnamurti', 'age': 6, 'email': 'kawyakrishnamurti@gmail.com'},
    {'name': 'Pallavi jain', 'age': 2, 'email': 'pallavijain@gmail.com'},
    {
        ordered: false
    }
)
```

```bash
$ db.demo.insertOne(
    {'name': 'Kawya krishnamurti', 'age': 6, 'email': 'kawyakrishnamurti@gmail.com'},
    {'name': 'Pallavi jain', 'age': 2, 'email': 'pallavijain@gmail.com'},
    {
        ordered: true   //bydefault
    }
)
```

At the third parameter we are giving an _--option flag_ which will become very important at the scenario where we are trying to insert more documents in a single collection. How will this help us? let's understand.........

Suppose we are inserting 1000 documents in a collection it might be possible that any file has some errors. It may be. In order to insert documents in that collection mongodb thrown error and hence documents will not be inserted because of the error. Let say there is only one file which was creating the error does it make sense to discard or terminate the whole process?

Absolutely not!

So, when we insert documents with the flas of _{ordered: false}_, mongodb will insert all the documents which is not producing any kind of errors and terminate the document in which there might be errors. On the other hand, if we use this :-

_{ordered: true}_ if any file contains any kind of error mongodb terminate the whole process and return the error.
