# Micro Frontend Architecture Patterns

When i tried to start a project initially it looks good like initially is looks like simple, organized and easy to read but when i continue to start building the project without having the knowledge about the frontend system design, the component that was looking good previously it starts becoming complex and code get meshed and the readability of that code is become very poor.

But after watching the video about 4-5 minutes they introduce _micro frontend architecture_ and shared some knowledge about this then i realise that ooooo... this is the thing that is missing in my project and so that's why my code gets bulky.

I think it's must to know for building projects in a scalable manner and this is what i should know to become a good frontend developer.
