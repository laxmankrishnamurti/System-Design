# Things to consider in Frontend System Design.

1. Requirements ===> What are the things that you wanted to have in your applicatin.

2. Scoping(Priortization) ===> It's obvious that we can't make all functionalities or features at once so we must priortize our work.

3. Tech Choices ===> It is very crutial point of any frontend application to choose a tech stack to develop the product. The decision depends on various factors, like

   - Popularity of the technology
   - Core features
   - Flexibility
   - Ease of integration
   - SSR(Server-Side rendering) support
   - Mobile support
   - Community
   - Future support
   - Market adoption

4. Component Architecture ===> We deeply look at up the core level component of the main component that is described in the _high level design_.

5. Data API & Protocols & Implementation ===> In this section we'll look at up the network calls that would be happen from the frontend to the backend server to perfrom CRUD operations and how we can implement them and optimized on frontend level so that each component has it's data.
