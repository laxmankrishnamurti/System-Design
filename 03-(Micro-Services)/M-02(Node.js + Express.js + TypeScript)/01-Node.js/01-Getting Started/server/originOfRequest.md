# Origin of Request

You're on the right track! Let's break it down step-by-step to understand the origin of requests and how they're intercepted and made accessible to Node.js or any backend technology on your computer.

### 1. **Internet Infrastructure Basics**

- **Networks and Routers**: When your laptop is connected to a network (e.g., via Wi-Fi), it’s connected to a router, which communicates with other routers and servers over the internet.
- **IP Address**: Each device on the internet has a unique IP address, allowing data to be directed to the right place. So, when a request is made to your computer (say, to `localhost`), it's actually directed to your device’s IP address (or `127.0.0.1` in the case of `localhost`).
- **TCP/IP Protocol**: This protocol is fundamental to data transmission over the internet. When data is sent over the internet, it’s broken into small packets and sent to the target IP address over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), ensuring each packet reaches its destination in the correct order.

### 2. **Interception of Requests: Network Stack and Operating System**

- **Network Stack**: When a request arrives at your computer, it travels up the **network stack** of your operating system, which includes layers responsible for different functions, such as routing and handling network protocols.
- **Operating System (OS)**: The OS manages incoming network data using this network stack. The OS’s **TCP/IP layer** reads incoming packets, reassembles them, and directs them to the appropriate application (like Node.js) based on the port number and IP address.
- **Sockets**: To receive data, applications use **sockets**. A socket is an endpoint for network communication. When you run a server in Node.js, it creates a **TCP socket** bound to a port (e.g., 3000). This socket listens for incoming packets on that port.

### 3. **From Operating System to Node.js (or Any Backend Framework)**

- **libuv and Sockets**: Node.js uses **libuv**, a C library, to interface with the operating system’s networking capabilities. Libuv provides Node.js with asynchronous I/O and manages the socket. When data arrives at the socket, libuv notifies Node.js, which triggers the `request` event on the HTTP server.
- **Request and Response Objects**: Once Node.js is notified, it generates the **`IncomingMessage`** object for the request and the **`ServerResponse`** object for the response. These objects contain all the details of the request that Node.js needs, including headers, body, and HTTP method.
- **Data Handling**: Node.js now has access to the full request and can respond to it. When it sends a response, libuv again interacts with the OS to ensure the data packets are sent to the client through the network stack.

### 4. **Physical and Wireless Transmission**

- Although you’re not physically connected with cables, data still reaches your laptop via **Wi-Fi**, which uses radio signals to send and receive data packets. The router converts data into radio signals and sends them wirelessly. When your laptop receives these signals, the network card decodes them back into digital data, which is then handled by the operating system.

### 5. **Node.js as a High-Level Interface**

- Just as you described, **Node.js is essentially an interface** that allows you to interact with intercepted requests. However, this interface is layered over several systems: the network stack, OS sockets, and libuv, which collectively allow the data to reach Node.js in a structured format.
- Node.js then abstracts these details, giving you the convenience of interacting with `req` and `res` objects directly, without needing to manage low-level details of how data physically arrived.

### Summary

- **Origin of the Request**: Starts as data packets sent over the internet to your device’s IP address.
- **Interception**: The OS receives and reassembles these packets, directing them to the right application.
- **Access in Node.js**: Through libuv, Node.js interacts with the OS and makes requests accessible in the form of `req` and `res` objects, allowing you to read and respond to them in JavaScript.

In short, Node.js operates at a higher layer, abstracting away the complexities of networking and hardware, while layers below Node.js (OS, network stack, libuv) manage the actual interception and handling of requests.

### Flow-chart

- **1. Client send**
- **2. Data packets**
- **3. To the destination IP address**
- **4. OS receives and reassembles these packets**
- **5. Network stack**
- **6. Network socket get triggered**
- **7. libev notify about that to**
- **8. Node.js**
- **9. _request event_ has been triggered on the HTTP server and create a request object and**
- **10. Process that request**
- **11. Trigger _response event_ and creates a response object to send response back to the client.**

**_The server created by createServer() is a universal server that listens for all incoming requests on the specified port. It uses the same server instance to handle each request by creating new IncomingMessage and ServerResponse objects each time._**
