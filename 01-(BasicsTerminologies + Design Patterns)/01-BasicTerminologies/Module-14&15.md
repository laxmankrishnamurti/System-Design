# Cache Eviction Strategies

Applying caching in an application is essential and it is equally important to delete the cahce from the memory to free the momory. These are the some important caching eviction strategies :-

1. LRU (Least recently used) ==> Required extra memory for tracking
2. MRU (Most recently used) ===> If frequently updating or deleting
3. LFU (Least frequently used)
4. FIFO (First in First out)
5. LIFO (Last in First out)
6. RR (Random Replacement)

# File-Based Storage System | File Based Database Management System | DBMS

A file based storage system is a database management system where data is stored in the form of files.

# Challenges of File Based Storage System

1. Data Redundency ===> Update anamoly, delete anamoly leading to data inconsistency.
2. Poor security ===> Same data are present in the system which causes a possibility of data breaches by unauthorised users.
3. Slow ===> The spped of file based storage system is very slow.

Due to these challenges, data retrieval is not very efficient.
