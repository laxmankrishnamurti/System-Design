_Before deep dive into modules let's first understand about modular programming._

## **What is modular programming?**

- **It is a system design techniques.**

  ### **What is system design?**

  - System design is the process of conceptualizing how a software system will work before it is implemented or modified.
  - Software design also refers to the direct result of the design process.
  - Software design usually is directed by goals for the resulting system and involves problem-solving and planning - including :-
    - High-level software architecture
    - Low-level component and
    - Algorithm design

- **It emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangable modules**
- **Each module contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of _'concern'_ of the desired functionality**

<code>To be more precise, in modular programming we have collection of modules which consists of pre-wirtten functions that does a particular task to achieve or solve a particular problem. Where each module is independent and have their own use-cases which we can import into our program files and use it's pre-written functions. That's it. Just make it simple as much as possible.</code>
