# Getting started

Webpack is used to compile JavaScript modules. Let's clearify all doubts regarding _modules_

Modules are nothing but the files which we create while developing an application in which we write some logics for the application and there can be some assets. All of these comes together and treated as a modules. That's it.

In a module there can be :-

- Some HTML files
- Some CSS files
- Some JavaScript files
- Some assets which we have used in the application
  - Can be static
  - Can be dynamic

So, we know that webpack is a bundler and it's job is to combine these files while are in different-different modules, into a single module.
