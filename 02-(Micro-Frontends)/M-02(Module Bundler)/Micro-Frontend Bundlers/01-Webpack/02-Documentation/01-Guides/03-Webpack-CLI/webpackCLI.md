# Webpack command line interface

- Webpack CLI is used for proper usage and easier distribution of the configured _webpack.config.ts_ file.

- Any parameter sent to the CLI will map to a corresponding parameter in the configuration file.

- webpack-cli offers a variety of commands to make working with webpack easier. By default webpack ships with

```json
{
  "build": "Run webpack",
  "configtest": "Validate a webpack configuration",
  "init": "Initialize a new webpack project",
  "loader": "scaffold a loader",
  "plugin": "scaffold a plugin",
  "watch": "Run webpack and watch for files changes"
}
```
