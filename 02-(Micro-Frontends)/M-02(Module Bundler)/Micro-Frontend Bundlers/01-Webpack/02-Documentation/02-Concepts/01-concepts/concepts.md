# Concepts

- At it's core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
- When it processses our application, it actually starts building a _dependency graph_ from one or more entry point which is defined in the project configuration file.
- And then combines every module as per our project need into one or more bundles.
- These bundles are static assets to server as content.
