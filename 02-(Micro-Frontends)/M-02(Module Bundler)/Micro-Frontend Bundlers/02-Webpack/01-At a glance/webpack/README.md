There are two main directory which is necessary for webpack, are:-

- src
- dist

Both should be in the root directory.

**At the end webpack is just a bundler so it requires some entry point to compile all files and compose it into a single module**

- src

  - entry point
    - index.js

- dist
  - entry point
    - index.html
