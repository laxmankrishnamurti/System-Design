# Technical Jargons in Webpack

Hereâ€™s a quick glossary of Webpack terms:

- **Chunks**: Small pieces of JavaScript code that Webpack splits during the bundling process. Chunks can include your app code or dependencies.

- **Bundles**: The final output files generated by Webpack after processing your app. Each bundle contains one or more chunks.

- **Runtime Logic**: Code Webpack generates to manage module loading, dependencies, and execution during runtime.

- **Modules**: Individual files (like `index.js`, `lodash`, or CSS) that Webpack processes and combines into chunks.

- **Entry Point**: The starting file(s) Webpack uses to begin bundling (e.g., `index.js`).

- **Output**: The configuration that defines where Webpack writes the final bundles (e.g., `dist` folder).

- **Loaders**: Tools that allow Webpack to process non-JS files like CSS, images, or TypeScript.

- **Plugins**: Add-ons that extend Webpack's functionality, like HTML generation or bundle optimization.

- **Tree Shaking**: A technique to remove unused code from the final bundle, making it smaller.

- **SplitChunks**: A Webpack feature that extracts shared dependencies into separate bundles to reduce duplication.

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: A feature to update modules in the browser during development without a full page reload.
