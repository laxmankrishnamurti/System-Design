# Where to start?

_helper :: ChatGPT_

Hereâ€™s a high-level path to building a microservices-based application:

1. **Design the System Architecture**

   - Identify core services (e.g., user service, payment service, etc.).
   - Define communication protocols (e.g., REST, gRPC, message queues).

2. **Set Up Environment**

   - Choose language/tech stack (e.g., Node.js with TypeScript).
   - Set up version control (Git).

3. **Create the Microservices**

   - Scaffold individual microservices (e.g., express.js for each service).
   - Define service-specific APIs and business logic.

4. **Containerize Each Microservice**

   - Write Dockerfiles for each service.
   - Build Docker images for local development.

5. **Set Up Inter-Service Communication**

   - Choose communication patterns (HTTP/REST, event-driven messaging, etc.).
   - Use message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) if necessary.

6. **Database Design**

   - Decide on database per service (SQL/NoSQL).
   - Handle data consistency and separation.

7. **Implement API Gateway**

   - Set up an API Gateway (e.g., NGINX, Kong) to route requests.
   - Handle rate-limiting, logging, and security at the gateway level.

8. **Set Up Authentication/Authorization**

   - Implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth2).
   - Use centralized auth service.

9. **Set Up Orchestration**

   - Define Kubernetes deployment manifests.
   - Use Helm charts for reusable configurations (optional).

10. **Logging & Monitoring**

    - Set up centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus).
    - Implement monitoring and health checks for each service.

11. **CI/CD Pipeline**

    - Set up continuous integration (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
    - Automate tests and container builds.
    - Deploy to Kubernetes or any orchestration platform.

12. **Scaling & Load Balancing**

    - Set up horizontal scaling.
    - Implement service mesh (e.g., Istio) for traffic management (optional).

13. **Security & Compliance**

    - Ensure encryption, API security, and service isolation.
    - Conduct penetration testing and follow security best practices.

14. **Testing & Performance Tuning**

    - Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
    - Perform load testing and optimize performance.

15. **Deploy to Production**

    - Use Kubernetes for production-grade orchestration.
    - Set up disaster recovery strategies.
