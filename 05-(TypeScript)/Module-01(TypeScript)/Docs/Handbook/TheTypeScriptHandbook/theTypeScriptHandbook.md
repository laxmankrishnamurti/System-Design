# TypeScript Handbook

Over the last 2 decades after its introduction to the programming community, JavaScript is now one of the most widespread cross-platform language ever created.

JavaScript had started its journey from a _small scripting language_ by adding trivial interactivity (things working together and influencing each other) to webpages. But now, after its exponential growth it is now being used in both frontend and backend to build a full-fleged web application of every size with ease.

But the ability of the JavaScript language to express the relationships between different units of code has not developed yet. The mismatch between language and program complexity has made JavaScript development a difficult task to manage at scale.

The most common kinds of errors that we face as a developer write can be described as type errors: a certain kind of value was used where a different kind of value was expected. This could be due to simple typos, a failure to understand the API surface of a library, incorrect assumptions about runtime behavior, or other errors.

**_The goal of TypeScript is to be a typechecker for JavaScript programs - in other words, TypeScript is the tool that runs before our code runs (static) and ensures that the types of the program are correct(Type should be checked before code runs)_**
