**_TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types_**
**_TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving use better tooling at any scale._**

## What is TypeScript?

- **_TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a "Tighter integration with our editor"._**

- **_Catch potential errors during development time in the code editor_**

- **_TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which "runs anywhere JavaScript run:" in a browser, on Node.js, or Deno,.....etc, with any kind of environment where JavaScript run._**

- **_TypeScript builds on top of JavaScript so, it understand JavaScript as well and uses "type inference(a conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning) to give us great tooling" without additional code._**
