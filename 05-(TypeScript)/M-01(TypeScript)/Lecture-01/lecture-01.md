# What is TypeScript?

In general when we write code in JavaScript and we have made a mistake in the code, the error will not show until we run the program. It means JavaScript gives error at runtime rather than development.

TypeScript comes into picture, it will throw error if we done anything wrong in the code.

- TypeScript is strongly-types superset of JavaScript.
- It adds static typing to the language and other features to0.
- Provides better error checking, enhanced tools, improved code readability.

# TypeScript VS JavaScript

**1. TypeScript is statically typed but JavaScript is dynamically typed.**

```ts
let name = "laxman"
name = 22 (not allowd in TypeScript.)
```

```js
let name = "Sonu";
name = 22(allowd in JavaS);
```

**2. Compilation**

TypeScript ===> Need to compile
JavaScript ===> Directly executed by browser

**3. Error checking**

TypeScript ===> Compile-time error checking
JavaScript ===> Errors occur at runtime

**4. Support for OOP**

TypeScript ===> Better support with interfaces, classes, generics
JavaScript ===> Basic support with prototype-based

**5. Code Scalability**

TypeScript ===> Easier to scale with static types, interface and strong typing
JavaScript ==> More chanllenging to scale due to dynamic typing

**6. Use case**

TypeScript ===> Suitable for large, complex applications
JavaScript ===> Ideal for smaller project and fast prototyping
